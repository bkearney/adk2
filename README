This is some initial thinking around an appliance development kit.
It is very rudimentary, and requires checkouts of the latest
bits to function. But.. it is good enough to be criticized.

SETUP
=====
* yum install pungi git PyYAML python-cheetah
* If you plan to use the EC2 bits:
** Install the ami tools from http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=368
*** The RPMs are the preferred installation. 
    If you use the zip file, ensure that the ec2-ami-tools***/bin/ directory is in your path and that the
    EC2_HOME directory is setup as defined in the readme-install.txt file.
** Install the ec2 api tools: http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=351&categoryID=88
* The location of this file is the ADK_HOME directory. 
* change to the ADK_HOME directory
* copy adk.yml.example to adk.yml
* copy appliance.yml.example to appliance.yml
* edit the yml file for more settings
* su to root
* change to the ADK_HOME directory
* . adk.rc


RUNNING
=======
Now you can run it. Some things you can do:
adk list appliances : See the appliances
adk list settings : See the settings
adk list plugins: See the plugins 
adk gather [APPLIANCE] : Download the src rpms for an appliance
adk srciso [APPLIANCE] : Build source rpm isos for an appliance
adk appliance [APPLIANCE] : Build the appliance
