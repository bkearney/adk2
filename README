This is some initial thinking around an appliance development kit.
It is very rudimentary, and requires checkouts of the latest
bits to function. But.. it is good enough to be criticized.

SETUP
=====
* yum install pungi git hg PyYAML
* Install the ami tools from http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=368
* change to the ADK_HOME directory
* execute setup.sh
* copy adk.yml.example to adk.yml
* copy appliance.yml.example to appliance.yml
* edit the yml file for more settings
* su to root
* change to the ADK_HOME directory
* . ./adk.rc


RUNNING
=======
Now you can run it. Some things you can do:
adk list appliances : See the appliances
adk list settings : See the settings
adk list plugins: See the plugins 
adk gather [APPLIANCE] : Download the src rpms for an appliance
adk srciso [APPLIANCE] : Build source rpm isos for an appliance
